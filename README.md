# Hi, I'm Ganesh 👋

I build AI-powered products and ship working prototypes that demonstrate real product thinking.

Most of my work is hands-on: real systems, clear frameworks, and tested approaches for AI/ML products, IoT platforms, predictive analytics, and enterprise security. I focus on translating complex technical problems into products that deliver measurable business outcomes.

I specialize in taking products from 0→1 and scaling them to serve Fortune 500 customers—combining deep technical understanding with strategic product execution.

## What I Work On

* 🏢 **AI-powered platforms**: Smart building systems, predictive maintenance, ML-driven optimization at enterprise scale
* 🔒 **Cybersecurity products**: NDR platforms with ML threat detection, SIEM/SOAR integrations, zero-trust architecture
* ⚡ **IoT infrastructure**: Edge systems processing 50M+ events daily, real-time analytics, distributed architectures
* 📊 **Product frameworks**: RICE prioritization, PMF evaluation, strategic roadmaps, Jobs-to-be-Done analysis
* 🎯 **Enterprise features**: Multi-tenancy, approval workflows, credit systems, workspace management, team collaboration
* 🚀 **System designs**: End-to-end architecture for AI/ML products, from data pipelines to user interfaces
* 💡 **Interactive prototypes**: Production-quality React apps with real state management—not just mockups
