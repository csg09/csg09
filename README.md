## 🎯 Product Philosophy

Great enterprise products require three things:

1. **Deep Technical Understanding** - Know the infrastructure, protocols, and constraints
2. **Customer-Centric Discovery** - Solve real operational problems, not hypothetical ones
3. **Measurable Business Impact** - Every feature must tie to cost savings, efficiency, or revenue

I focus on mastering all three while building high-performing cross-functional teams.
