# Hi, I'm Ganesh 👋

I build AI-powered products at enterprise scale and ship working solutions that demonstrate real product thinking.

Most of my work is hands-on: real systems, clear frameworks, and production-ready architectures for AI/ML products, predictive analytics, and intelligent automation. I focus on translating complex technical challenges into products that deliver measurable business outcomes—$2M+ savings, 100M+ data points processed daily, 99.99% uptime.

I specialize in taking AI products from 0→1 and scaling them to serve Fortune 500 customers across 150+ global facilities.

## What I Build

* **AI/ML Systems**: Predictive maintenance engines → anomaly detection → optimization loops → real-time decision systems
* **Production Architectures**: How to structure ML pipelines, handle 100M+ data points daily, scale to 99.99% uptime
* **Enterprise AI Products**: Multi-tenant platforms → workspace management → approval workflows → credit systems → team collaboration
* **Predictive Analytics**: Time-series forecasting → sensor fusion → load prediction → PUE optimization (1.8→1.4)
* **Intelligent Automation**: RL-based optimization → A/B testing frameworks → automated response systems
* **Security AI Products**: ML threat detection → SIEM/SOAR integration → anomaly detection → automated incident response
* **IoT + AI Platforms**: Edge computing → distributed systems processing 50M+ events/day → real-time fleet optimization
* **Product Frameworks**: RICE prioritization → PMF evaluation → strategic roadmaps → Jobs-to-be-Done → impact analysis
* **Working Prototypes**: React apps with real state management → production-quality UI → end-to-end workflows
* **System Designs**: Architecture docs for AI/ML products → data pipelines → API design → integration patterns
